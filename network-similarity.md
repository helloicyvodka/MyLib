Actually, tree blast for similar topology problem can transform and expand to network blast problem.
I suppose that a network should contain nodes and edges. Edges can be defined with strength. For example, clear lineage relationship can be defined as 1 strength which means absolute relationship.
Thus, I do a research of network blast problem.
